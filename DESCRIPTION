Description: Splits initial strata into refined strata that optimize covariate balance. For more information, please see Brumberg, Small, and Rosenbaum (2024) <doi:10.1093/biomtc/ujae061>. To solve the linear program, the 'Gurobi' commercial optimization software is recommended, but not required. The 'gurobi' R package can be installed following the instructions at <https://docs.gurobi.com/projects/optimizer/en/current/reference/r/setup.html> after claiming your free academic license at <https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/>.
